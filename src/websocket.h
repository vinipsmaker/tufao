  This class represents a WebSocket connection.

  WebSocket is a protocol designed to allow HTTP user agents and servers
  communicates using a two-way protocol. It's possible to upgrade an established
  HTTP connection to a WebSocket connection.

  # WebSocket server

  If you intend to create a server able to accept WebSocket connections, you
  must create a HTTP server and create a handler to upgrade events.

  In the handler for the upgrade event, you must create a new WebSocket object
  and call the method startServerHandshake. This method will send the initial
  WebSocket server payload and check if it's a valid WebSocket connection
  request.

  # WebSocket client

  If you intend to connect to a WebSocket server, you must call one of the
  connectToHost methods. If the connection should be encrypted, then call one of
  the connectToHostEncrypted methods. The connected signal will emitted when the
  socket is ready.

      using the \p headers argument.

      \note
      Optional headers such as Origin aren't added by default. If you want to
      use one of the headers, you should add them explicitly. The list of common
      optional headers is the following:
        - Origin: RFC 6454. If your software is a browser client, this field is
          mandatory, not optional.
        - Sec-WebSocket-Protocol: If present, this value indicates one or more
          comma-separated subprotocol the client wishes to speak, ordered by
          preference.

      \note
      If the object fail to establish a connection, it will emit disconnected
      signal. If it procceds, it will emit the connected signal.

      put the headers you want to send in the response in the \p headers
      argument. Some headers you may want to treat are:
        - Origin: Compare the Origin to the Host to block malicious scripts
