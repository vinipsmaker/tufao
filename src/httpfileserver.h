/*!
  You can use this class to serve static files under Tufão. It provides a robust
  HTTP file server, supporting conditional and byte-range requests.

  The two main approaches are:
    - Construct an object and use the AbstractHttpServerRequestHandler API
      implemented by HttpFileServer
    - Use the static methods to serve a file (or set the entity in the response
      body)

  The algorithm used to serve files will handle the following set of headers:
    - If-Modified-Since
    - If-Unmodified-Since
    - If-Range
    - Range
    - Content-Type through QMimeDatabase (_Since version 1.0_)

  It won't handle:
    - ETag (If-Match and If-None-Match headers)
    - Cache-Control response header: Useful for set cache max age
    - Content-Disposition response header
    - Content-MD5 response header
